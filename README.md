Mira (Multimodal Interactive Recognition Agent) is a voice-activated, vision-enhanced AI assistant that blends computer vision, speech recognition, and large language models into one seamless experience. It can see, speak, listen, understand, and respond — just like a real assistant. Perfect for desktop AI experiences and multimodal experimentation.

## 🌟 Features

* 🧠 **LLM-Powered Chat** — Uses Gemini 2.0 Flash for intelligent, conversational interactions.
* 👁️ **Visual Understanding** — Uses BLIP (Salesforce) to caption real-time webcam imagery.
* 🎤 **Speech-to-Text** — Converts your voice to text with `speech_recognition`.
* 🔊 **Text-to-Speech** — Replies audibly using `gTTS` and plays responses via `pygame`.
* 🌐 **Multilingual Support** — Supports both English and French voice interaction.
* 💬 **Contextual Memory** — Keeps track of chat history for smarter responses.
* 🗂️ **Training Dataset Builder** — Saves captioned images for use in fine-tuning or ML training.
* 🔐 **Secure API Access** — Includes basic key management with encryption for Gemini API.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* macOS (M2 GPU preferred), Windows or Linux
* Webcam
* Microphone
* [Google Gemini API Key](https://ai.google.dev/)

### 📦 Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or manually install:

```bash
pip install opencv-python torch transformers gtts pygame SpeechRecognition google-generativeai
```

---

## 🛠️ Usage

### 🔹 Launch the Assistant

```bash
python voice.py
```

Say **"Jack"** (🇺🇸) or **"Jacques"** (🇫🇷) to wake Mira.

> Example:
> "Hey Jack, what's the weather today?"
> "Jacques, parle-moi de l’intelligence artificielle."

Say **"That's all"** to put Mira back to sleep.

### 🔹 Launch Visual Captioning (Optional)

```bash
python vision.py
```

This will:

* Continuously capture webcam frames
* Generate captions using BLIP
* Display captions on screen
* Save captioned images to `train/images`
* Log all captions in `annotations.json`

---

## 🧠 How It Works

Mira integrates three threaded systems:

1. **Listener Thread** — Captures voice input and converts it to text.
2. **LLM Thread** — Sends text input to Gemini and streams back responses.
3. **TTS Thread** — Converts responses to audio and plays them via `pygame`.

If `vision.py` is active, it:

* Captures frames every 2 seconds
* Captions them with BLIP
* Updates UI with the current description
* Saves labeled data for ML training

## 🔒 Security Note

If you want to use an API, Key Manager would encrypted and accessed via the `key_manager` module.
**Never hardcode sensitive keys into public scripts.**
